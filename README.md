# nest-utils

## Description

Contains Sierra Labs commonly used code like postgres naming strategy, nest decorators, and pipes.

## Requirements

Make sure to have the following installed

* `NodeJS / NPM` for application runtime
* `NestJS` for application framework

## Installation

To use the `nest-utils` node module:

```bash
$ npm install --save @sierralabs/nest-utils
```

## Postgres Naming Strategy

TypeORM by default retains camelCase naming convention for table and column names. Also, constraints, relations, primary keys, and foreign key names generated by TypeORM do not follow industry best practices. The `PostgresNamingStrategy` overrides TypeORM's default naming strategy.

To use, modify the NestJS module imports to include the `namingStrategy` property:

```javascript
TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
  ...
  namingStrategy: new PostgresNamingStrategy()
});
```

## Config Module based on ConvictJS
